FoosBall
========

This is a foosball game built in java 
It is an attempt to get the real foosball game created in java.
I want to refine it further so that there are no bugs left and then release it online.
There are some bugs like when the ball reaches the bottom right corner of the screen it escapes and sometimes the ball
stucks in the upper middle section.
